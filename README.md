My first repo on GitHub!
This was an assignment from a Code Fellows intro to CS/Web Design course.  I chose the website of the high school I have been teaching at (St. Mary's Academy in downtown Portland, Oregon)

The goal was to build a skeleton HTML that reflects the structural organization of their website.

My outline produced by: https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/   was the following:
